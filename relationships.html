							<h4>Peer Relationships</h4>
							<p>Growing up, I moved many times due to my dad's job: a total of 13 times. Once I got into elementary school, we began to become more settled, only moving once every 3-4 years. Since I didn't spend that much time in one place, I didn't really make many friends until middle school, and didn't make many lasting relationships. Most of my peers were from school or extracurriculars I did until moving to California where we lived for 4 years, where I found many people that I cherish and care for. </p>
							<h4>Parent Relationships</h4>
							<p>Since I moved so often, I spent most of my time with my parents or grandparents. As I grew up, I was a single child until I was 7, when my sister was born. Once my sister happened, most of my parent's attention was turned to her, and I became more independent.</p>
