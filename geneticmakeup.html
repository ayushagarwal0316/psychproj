							<h1>Genetic Makeup</h1>
							<p>One's genetic makeup consists of traits one inherits from their parents DNA. <p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images1/dna.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<h4>Parental Traits to Self</h4>
							<p>Physically, I share many features with my mother, in my facial structure and details like eye color, nose shape, and cheekbones. Mentally, I excell at math and science much like my dad, who also gave me my ability to think logically. My mother and I share an interest in cuisine and art. </p>
							<h4>Dominant and Recessive Traits</h4>
							<p> I received a dominant trait because one or both of my parents had a dominant trait in their
									genes, and it  was passed to
									me, which was then expressed in my phenotype, and became a part of my physical appearance. My recessive traits were received
									because both of my parents had at least one recessive gene, and both the chromosomes
									that contained the recessive genes were passed down to me. These recessive traits were
									then expressed in my phenotype, since there were no dominant traits present in my genotype to
									overpower them. A dominant trait I inherited are my detached earlobes, which both of my parents have.
									A dominant trait which I took from just my mother is the ability to roll my tongue, as my father cannot do it and my mothers dominant trait masked his recessive trait in my genotype.</p>
							<h4>Influence of Genetic Traits</h4>
							<p>My entire life has been affected by my parent's traits that have been passed down onto me. From my dad's need for glasses, to my mom's love of food, their traits have taught me to adapt to the world and allowed me to experience how to best apply my abilities in certain situations. My environment has always been changing as I've moved 8 times since we moved to the US, and my parent's nurturing has allowed me to grow socially and as a person although the constant change. My father's ability to reason and my mother's passion for cuisine have changed my life as I have been labeled as Gifted and Talented, and have had opportunities I would otherwise have ignored, such as participating in robotics or in hackathons. The culmination of their traits have made me who I am and make me into someone successful.</p>
							<h4>Sex Chromosomes</h4>
							<p>As a male, my chromosomes are XY. A female like my sister would have a secondary X chromosome, to make her sex chromosomes XX.</p>
