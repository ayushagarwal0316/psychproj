              <h1>Cultural Variables</h1>
							<p>Being Indian, I have had a very different upbringing compared to most Americans, as my parents are much more focused on my academics and studies, over sports and social life.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images1/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>Culture in my life</h4>
							<p>My parents were the first in my extended family to move to the US, and I was the first person in my entire family to be entirely educated in the US. This puts a lot of pressure on me, to get into a good college and become successful enough to support my parents.</p>
							<p> While growing up, I haven't had an issue with being a minority, and have rather made it part of me. Joking around with my culture has become a part of me, and being in America, I have never had many issues with being prejudiced against.</p>
