							<h1>Future Career</h1>
							<p>Since I was young I've known that I want to pursue a job in the STEM field. In the past year, that focus has become more narrow, as I want to go to college for a degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering and then go on to work at a prestigious company as a programmer or engineer.</p>

							<h2>College</h2>
							<p>Going to college is a must for me, but I am unsure as to where I'll go. I would like to major in Computer Engineering or Computer Science, and am looking at many colleges that are strong in these fields. Going out of state is my preference, but UT Austin has a very strong Computer Science program. My college success will determine the rest of my career, so it is very important to me.</p>
							<h2>Career</h2>
							<p>After college I would like to work at a company like SpaceX or Google, pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation. Going to a good college is imperative to such a prestigious job.</p>
